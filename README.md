# hello-world

To force myself to start contributing to github, of which until now I have only been a consumer and bug-submitter, I figured I would start uploading some of the last 20 years of random tools that I have written that others might find useful.  Then I found myself overthinking questions of how to properly segment those into repositories, and so to just get myself moving I decided to take a page from the world of Buddhist philosophy and approach github with "beginner's mind".  So this is me, going through the steps in https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ , even though it seems super-basic and also doesn't use the CLI and thus makes me a little itchy.

(Note to self: Maybe I should do these notes-to-self as issues on this repo?  Yes, that is overcomplicating the tutorial before finishing step one of it, but I like that idea.)

(Note to self: also add an issue to look into whether you can tweak the size of the text-edit box on the GH website.)

(AND: if there's a way to autogenerate issues from inside the text editor, and/or experiment with whether switching to issues tab loses textediting changes?)
